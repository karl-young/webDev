          Step into a neon world of flashing lights, pixel battles, and
          snack-fueled high score wars.

          This site is all about the classic arcade games that made growing up
          in the 80s and 90s unforgettable.

        <p>
          From the first time I beat the boss in Street Fighter II, to losing my
          last token in Galaga, these memories live on.

        <h2>Trivia</h2>
        <ul>
          <p>💡 Did You Know?</p>
          <li>
            Pac-Man was originally going to be called “Puck-Man” <br />
            but the name was changed for the American release to stop people
            from vandalizing the "P" into an "F" on the cabinets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Street Fighter II was so popular that some arcade machines broke
            from overuse <br />
            and arcades would line them with fans to cool them down.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Donkey Kong arcade game was the first appearance of Mario <br />
            but back then, he was just called “Jumpman.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Galaga was one of the first arcade games to have a continue feature
            <br />
            but only if you pressed start within a few seconds after dying.
          </li>
          <li>
            Dance Dance Revolution became so intense that some arcades had to
            put up signs warning players not to play after eating!
          </li>
          <li>
            Arcades were such a big deal in Japan that some machines had
            ashtrays built into them <br />
            smoking while playing was totally normal.
